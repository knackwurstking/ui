# Review

Based on my analysis, here are the key problems and missing components in your CSS library:

## Critical Missing Components

- Form validation styling (error/success states)
- Navigation components (breadcrumbs, menus, dropdowns)
- Data display (table variants, accordions, timelines)
- Feedback components (alerts, tooltips, loading skeletons)

## Modern CSS Features Missing

- Container queries support
- CSS logical properties (margin-inline, padding-block)
- CSS layers for cascade management
- Scroll-driven animations

## Accessibility Gaps

- Screen reader utilities
- Focus trap for modals
- Skip links styling
- Enhanced high contrast mode

## File Organization Issues

- Inconsistent structure (button has subdirectory, others don't)
- Mixed HTML vs component categorization
- Theme imported before reset (incorrect order)

## Theme System Incompleteness

- No theme transition animations
- Missing system theme detection
- Limited color contrast utilities

## Utility Classes Missing

- Object-fit utilities
- Print utilities
- Animation utilities
- Touch-action utilities

The framework has a solid foundation but needs significant expansion for comprehensive modern web development. Priority areas are form components, navigation, and accessibility enhancements.
